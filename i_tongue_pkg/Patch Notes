Patch notes
Nerfed: Emergency Stop
The area of the Emergency Stop has been decreased.

Buffed: Control Function
The control function has been improved and now uses an exponential function to move forward and rotate. This decreases the sensivity of the ITCI close to the center, since it may be hard to activate the desired button here.

 
Minor Changes: Additional buttons
The area of the R, L and F buttons have been decreased. This has resulted in a two additional buttons LF and RF, which allows the controller to move forward and rotate at the same time. The division is giving on the whiteboard
How to divide it in code can be seen in function "which_direction"
